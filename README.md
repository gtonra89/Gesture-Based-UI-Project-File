# Gesture-Based-UI-Project-File
Develop an application with a Natural User Interface. You have a choice of technologies available to you and an opportunity 
to combine a lot of technology that you have worked with over the past four years.

## **_Research and Concepts_**
So we had a lot of choice in this project and a lot of freedom we had to work in pairs so we both had Rasberry pis but wernet to sure to do with them. 
The college had a range of tech that we could have used for example they had [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) , [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) , [Leap motiom](https://www.leapmotion.com/) 
and also we did in lab tutorials in how to work with [Cortona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana). But we wanted something where we can use the rasberry pi or even an adruino as students we didnt want to invest to much in buying much gear for that like a camera or screen for the pi, we decided to use the Leap motion.

**concept one**
Was to use leap motion with the rasberry pi work between them was going to a stream and than an adruino to connect with 2 servos

**concept Two**
We decided to drop the Rasberri pi as there was a lot of work with the stream to connect time was not our side so we decided to for a leap to adruino with a breadboard circuit with LED lights attached.

## **_OverView Of the Project_**
The Project involves the leap motion and connecting it with the Arduino Using Node Js Librarys Running a few commands this will lead to hand gestures from the lep motion 
and sending a signal to a circuit board with led lights that change color with the different gestures. 
There is a video demo of the project below.
